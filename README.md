# Nyx's new portfolio

Currently reworking my portfolio!

Whereas my current portfolio, nyxviolet.com, is a one page and is convenient like that, I feel like it's too restrictive for the content I want to put inside. I am restricted to 5ish projects but I want to be able to add more and maybe also less serious ones.

My new portfolio will have 3 pages: Highlights, About me & Playground.

Highlights will include my newest/best works, similar to what is already on my current portfolio.
About me will include a description of myself and where to contact me.
Playground will be a place where i can just add all the projects I want, including less serious personal projects and unfinished projects, so that employers can have a better idea of who I am as a person and show that I do a LOT of stuff, it's just usually hidden on my computer for noone to see.
